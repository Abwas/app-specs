## Motivation

Build software is similar to build a house, it takes **careful planning** and **precise information architecture** before you can hammer that first nail, or, in this case, punch up that first string of code.

We always need to be clear about what we want to achieve. Otherwise, we'll never know if we reached our goals.

Specifications are very important for several reasons:

- Understanding project requirements
- Developing a project scope
- Estimating project time-frame and pricing
- Creating a workable reference for development and design

## Purpose

Our intention is to provide professional specifications that are agnostic, i.e, can be implemented using any programming language/stack.

## How it works

## How to collaborate
