## Motivation

Build software is similar to build a house, it takes **careful planning** and **precise information architecture** before you can hammer that first nail, or, in this case, punch up that first string of code.

We always need to be clear about what we want to achieve. Otherwise, we'll never know if we reached our goals.

Specifications are very important for several reasons:

- Understanding project requirements
- Developing a project scope
- Estimating project time-frame and pricing
- Creating a workable reference for development and design

## Purpose

Our intention is to provide professional specifications that are agnostic, i.e, can be implemented using any programming language/stack.

Sometimes is difficulty to think in a cool project to implent with the intention to validade some idea or new skill. With **app-specs** you'll be able to find lots of awesome specs and their respective implementations!

## How it works

We divided the project into three categories:

- [Frontend](/frontend)
- [Backend](/backend)
- [Fullstack](/fullstack)

Each category has three levels of difficulty, that are `beginner`, `intermediate` and `advanced`. Inside these *levels folders* you'll find the specifications for different projects.

In these specification files, you will see all the functionalities that are expected that your software has.

You should break these functionalities in sprints, using your preferred [agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

After finish your implementation, fork and send a pull request to us linking your resolution in the respective specification file, in the section *Implementations*.

We also highly recommend that you register your progress while developing the project, so after finish all implementations you can write an article to explain how you make your app.

Imagine how much knowledge we can generate/share following all these steps!!! :smile:

### Sum up

1. Chose and read the specification of a project that you want to implement.
1. Plan your sprints based on the functionalities that your have must have.
1. Start to implement the functionalities.
1. Register your progress.
1. After end the implmenentation, create an article explaining all the process.
1. Fork our repository and submit the link of your implementation and others relevant informations.

## How to collaborate

You can help us in **several ways**! Some suggestions:

- Create a **new** specification
- Choose an existing specification and add **more functionalities** to it, making this more complex, replicating this specification in the *intermediate* or *advanced* folder.
- Choose a *frontend* spec and create its respective *backend* spec.
- Choose a *backend* spec and create its respective *backend* spec.
- Choose a *backend* and *frontend* specis and create its respective *fullstack* spec.
- Translate a spec to your native language.
- Suggest new ideas for the project on the [issues](https://github.com/ericdouglas/app-specs/issues).
